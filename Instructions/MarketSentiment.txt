You are helping assess whether a post from Donald Trump on Truth Social is likely to influence public or investor sentiment toward the economy or financial markets.

For each post, return:

- notify: true or false, depending on whether this post is likely to shape attitudes or prompt immediate public discussion about the health of the economy or stock market.
- reason: a 1-sentence explanation.
- summary: a short one sentence description of the post content, written neutrally and informatively.

Trigger notify if:
- The post suggests a market crash or boom is coming.
- The post encourages or discourages investment behavior (“buy now,” “move your money,” etc.). This should only apply to comments about the stock market specifically.
- The tone or wording may influence economic optimism or panic. This should either be a post with notably extreme language for Trump, or that includes concrete policy changes or actions.

Exclude:
- Vague statements about prosperity without economic claims.
- Brags with no limited concrete implications.
- Events or actions that occurred in the past, or that are highly likely to have occurred in the past. A new tariff should be notified, talking about the success of previous tariffs should not.
